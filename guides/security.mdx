## Create and store your password safely

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create a Password">
        Create a Save password with a combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters. (Here is a password generator that creates a safe password: [1password](https://1password.com/password-generator))
    </Step>
    <Step title="Store your Password somewhere safe">
        Store your password in a password manager, like for example: [1password](https://1password.com) and not just in your browser, because it's very easy to get your password from your browser.
    </Step>
